【商戶資料 / Shop Information】 <br>店名: Gia Trattoria Italiana<br>類別: 飲食<br>詳細分類: /<br>地址: 灣仔龍景街1號分域碼頭海軍商場1樓<br><br>原因: <br>【只屬傳言 / Hearsay ONLY】<br>網友報料指：<br>該老闆撐警，招呼警察入內休息，話示威者令佢地冇生意，支持送晒d年青人去新疆<br><br>【官方資訊 / Official Information】<br>官方發表澄清聲明：<br>To those it may concern,<br><br>I would like to address a recent wave of false and misinformed accusations targeting myself about my stance on the ongoing Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. I have NEVER publicly expressed my political stance during these highly distressing times, and certainly have *NOT*expressed support for the police, despite circulating social media posts that claim the former.<br><br>I plead you to thoroughly fact check any and all distressing information before spreading rumours about a person during such a politically turbulent time. The repercussions for false accusations like this affect not only me, but the people around me as well. I have always deeply admired the resilience of the Hong Konger spirit, and continue to do so.<br><br>Thank you for your attention,<br>Gianni Caprioli.<br><br>Source: <br><a href="http://bit.do/fx76p">http://bit.do/fx76p</a><br><a href="http://bit.do/fx77d">http://bit.do/fx77d</a><br>相關圖片:<br>/
