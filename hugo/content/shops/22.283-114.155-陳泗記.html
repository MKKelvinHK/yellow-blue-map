【商戶資料 / Shop Information】 <br>店名: 陳泗記<br>類別: 飲食<br>地址: 中環士丹利街74號<br>Openrice: <a href="https://s.openrice.com/QrbS0UYa000">https://s.openrice.com/QrbS0UYa000</a><br><br>原因: <br>【只屬傳言 / Hearsay ONLY】<br>網友報料指：I had lunch there today. The boss/ cook was criticising the protestors of doing whatever they want, looting and damaging properties. He further accused the 'university students' for pushing 'secondary school students' to the frontline and injuring themselves while the 'leaders' stay behind the scene. He clearly has a very biased view against the protestors.<br><br>Source: <br>/<br>相關圖片:<br>/
