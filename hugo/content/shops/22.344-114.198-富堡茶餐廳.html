During the first day of school, when I went in for lunch, I heard the cook (also sometimes cashier) spoke quite angrily saying ""我地唔會招呼啲老師"", I was wondering what happened and then I heard their kids said ""佢地係黃"" and the male waiter said ""We support police"", to be fair one of the female waiter said we should keep good relationship with the teachers, but the rest of the staff are still pretty angry and kept accusing teachers are ruining the society.<br><br>Source: <br>/<br>相關圖片:<br>/
